## Font Property

The font is a shorthand property for setting the font family, weight, size, variant, line height and style of a text.

### Example

The font property may be specified as either a single keyword, which will select a system font, or as a shorthand for various font-related properties.

```css
/* Set the font size to 80% of the parent element
   or default value (if no parent element present).
   Set the font family to sans-serif */

p { font: 80% sans-serif }

/* Set the font weight to bold,
   the font-style to italic,
   the font size to large,
   and the font family to serif. */
p { font: bold italic large serif }
```
